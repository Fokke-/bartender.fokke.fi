# Adding a new bar

Dialog element comes in two flavours, modal and standard dialog, which both are supported by the library. Modal will be used as a default.

## Modal

In modal mode focus will be trapped to the bar and interaction with elements outside the bar will be disabled.

::: tip
Remember to provide a way to close the bar with keyboard. Even though by default bar will be closed by hitting `esc` key or clicking outside the bar, adding a dedicated close button to the bar is highly recommended.
:::

## Standard dialog

In standard dialog mode bar will open as a fixed element and interaction with elements outside the bar is allowed. This mode can be useful if you plan to keep the bar as a permanent component of your layout.

::: info Note that in standard dialog mode the following exceptions will take place:

- Overlay shading will not be rendered.
- `permanent` setting will have no effect.
- Bar is not closeable by hitting `esc` key.
- Bar will not be closed by clicking outside the bar.
- Bar will not be closed when another bar is opened with `keepOtherBarsOpen: true`.
- Bar will not be closed when `Bartender.closeAll()` is called without any arguments.
